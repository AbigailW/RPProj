Idea for the dice rolling:

You were curious about potentially allowing the user to enter in their own ability scores...
We COULD just roll them and allow the user to enter a score into each ability--it's up to them
to either enter what was rolled or a different number. Kind of like an override..

So we have two options. We can:
1. Allow an override sort of thing, where everything that is random in a character
can be manually entered during the creation process
OR
2. Give the user a choice at the beginning. This would keep random characters accountable. 

Also, for entering these scores, we may want to make an "optimize" button that would 
give the best configuration of ability scores per class the user selected
(This would work by giving each class a list of most important to least important 
and then enter the scores from there.)
